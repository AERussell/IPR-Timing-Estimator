# IPR-Timing-Estimator

![Screenshot](/images/Screenshot.png)

This is a simple Excel spreadsheet with formulas to estimate certain deadlines in *inter partes review* (IPR) actions before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). 

It was created by Andrew E. Russell at Shaw Keller LLP in Wilmington, Delaware. **Please see the [IP/DE Blog](https://ipde.com) for more information.**

## Usage

Open the spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel, and fill in the date of the (hypothetical) filing of the IPR petition in the highlighted cell. The spreadsheet will auto-populate estimates for the remainder of the dates through the end of the IPR.

This may provide a useful framework for determining a rough estimate of the timing of an IPR for the purposes of budgeting or adjusting your filing date to correspond a desired schedule. 

Note that the spreadsheet is only intended as a rough estimate. Further, the dates depend on accurate input of the holidays in the "Holidays" tab. The pre-configured holidays may be incorrect.

Note that this spreadsheet **cannot** be used for calendaring, as the actual deadlines may be incorrect and will vary depending on other events (e.g., if the patentee files their opposition before it is due).
